# AI Governance Strategy Builder

An interactive strategic decision-making game for AI governance. Build comprehensive strategies to navigate the complex challenges of artificial intelligence development and deployment through evidence-based simulation and analysis.

## ðŸš€ Features

### ðŸ“Š Strategic Analysis
- **Comprehensive Simulation**: Monte Carlo analysis with 1000+ iteration statistical modeling
- **Professional Reporting**: Clear, readable strategic assessments and outcome predictions
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Immediate analysis of strategy effectiveness and trade-offs

### ðŸ“š Rich Educational Content
- **Detailed Descriptions**: Each mechanism includes comprehensive real-world context, historical examples, and current implementations
- **Research Links**: Direct access to academic papers, policy documents, and expert analysis from leading institutions
- **Evidence-Based**: All content derived from authoritative AI governance research and policy frameworks
- **Real-World Examples**: Current initiatives like G7 Hiroshima Process, EU AI Act, and US regulatory frameworks

### ðŸŽ¯ Comprehensive Strategy Building
- **9 Strategic Postures**: From laissez-faire to defensive accelerationism, cooperative development to strategic advantage
- **12 Institutional Frameworks**: International bodies, regulators, research organizations, emergency response hubs
- **13 Regulatory Mechanisms**: Licensing, transparency reports, liability frameworks, sector-specific prohibitions
- **7 Technical Controls**: Hardware verification, export controls, cloud enforcement, compute caps

### ðŸ”¬ Advanced Simulation
- **Synergy Detection**: Automatically identifies complementary and contradictory mechanism combinations
- **Resource Constraints**: Realistic pre-FTX collapse budget ($120B-$400B) and political capital modeling
- **Outcome Visualization**: Canvas-based charts showing probability distributions and success rates

## Data Sources

The tool integrates data from a relatively comprehensive custom-made datasets, which include:

- **Academic Literature References**: Research papers, policy analyses, and theoretical frameworks
- **Real-World Examples**: Current implementations and historical precedents
- **Potential Challenges**: Reasons that these governance ideas could go wrong

## ðŸŽ® How to Play

### Quick Start (No Setup Required)
1. Visit: **https://jack-stennett.github.io/AI-Governance-Strategy-Builder**
2. Select your difficulty level and strategic approach
3. Start building your AI governance strategy!

## How to Use

### Basic Workflow
1. **Select Difficulty**: Choose Easy ($300B, 24 PC), Medium ($220B, 20 PC), or Hard ($120B, 16 PC)
2. **Choose Strategic Posture**: Pick one macro-approach
3. **Build Your Portfolio**: Select institutional, regulatory, and technical options within budget
4. **Analyze Outcomes**: Find your results with a custom outcome generator

### Key Concepts
- **Budget**: Financial resources in billions of dollars
- **Political Capital (PC)**: Political feasibility and support required
- **Requirements**: Mandatory combinations for certain postures
- **Synergies**: Complementary options that enhance effectiveness
- **Contradictions**: Conflicting options that reduce overall success

### Advanced Features
- **Export**: Download your build configuration for sharing or analysis  
- **Help Modal**: Access detailed instructions and explanations with links to external references

### Requirements
- **Modern Browser**: Chrome 60+, Firefox 55+, Safari 12+, Edge 79+
- **JavaScript**: ES6 support (async/await, modules, arrow functions)
- **CSS**: Custom properties, flexbox, grid layout
- **APIs**: Fetch, localStorage, canvas (for charts)

### Recommended
- **Screen Size**: 1024x768 or larger for optimal experience; works on a portable telephone
- **Network**: Local server for full CSV data integration
- **JavaScript Enabled**: Required for all interactive features

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Frontend-Only**: Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - no backend required
- **Modular Design**: Separate modules for CSV parsing, UI rendering, and simulation
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Graceful fallback if CSV loading fails
- **Responsive Layout**: CSS Grid and Flexbox for adaptive design

### Data Integration
- **CSV Parser**: Custom implementation with error handling and fallbacks  
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Options populated from CSV data with rich metadata
- **Tooltip System**: Enhanced with full descriptions, literature links, and examples
- **Search Engine**: Real-time filtering across names, descriptions, and metadata

### Simulation Engine
- **Scoring Model**: Multi-factor success probability calculation
- **Monte Carlo**: 1000-iteration statistical analysis  
- **Visualization**: Canvas-based outcome distribution charts
- **Export Format**: JSON with timestamp, configuration, and results

## Customization

### Adding New Options
1. Edit `narratives.csv` and `synergies.csv` with new entries
2. Follow the existing column structure and data format
3. Refresh the browser to see changes

### Modifying Scoring
- Edit the `evaluateOnce()` function in `src/app.js`
- Adjust base scores, penalties, and bonuses as needed
- Update synergy and contradiction definitions in `SPEC` object

### Styling Changes
- Modify CSS custom properties in `:root` for color themes
- Adjust responsive breakpoints in media queries
- Customize tooltip appearance and behavior

## Accessibility
